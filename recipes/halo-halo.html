        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sinigang na Baboy is a classic Filipino dish known for its sour and savory flavor. This hearty pork soup is traditionally made with tamarind, which gives it its signature tanginess. The soup is loaded with vegetables like kangkong (water spinach), sitaw (long beans), eggplant, and radish, making it a nutritious and comforting meal. Sinigang na Baboy is often enjoyed during colder days or whenever a comforting, flavorful soup is desired. The combination of tender pork, fresh vegetables, and the sour broth makes it a beloved dish in Filipino households.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1.5 pounds (700g) pork belly or pork ribs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>8 cups water</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>1 packet sinigang mix (tamarind soup base) or 1/2 cup fresh tamarind paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce (patis)</li>
            <li>1 large eggplant, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup sitaw (long beans), cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup labanos (daikon radish), sliced into rounds</li>
            <li>1 large gabi (taro root), peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1-2 green chili peppers (optional)</li>
            <li>1 bunch kangkong (water spinach) or spinach</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the Pork: In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the pork belly or pork ribs and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the meat is tender. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.</li>
            <li>Add Aromatics: Add the quartered onions and tomatoes to the pot. Continue to simmer for another 10 minutes until the tomatoes soften.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Broth: Pour in the sinigang mix or fresh tamarind paste, stirring well to dissolve. Season with fish sauce, adjusting the sourness by adding more tamarind paste or mix if desired.</li>
            <li>Cook the Vegetables: Add the gabi (taro root) and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Then, add the sliced eggplant, sitaw (long beans), and labanos (radish). Simmer for another 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are cooked but still slightly crisp.</li>
            <li>Add Heat (Optional): If using green chili peppers, add them to the pot for a spicy kick. Simmer for 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the Greens: Finally, add the kangkong (water spinach) or spinach to the pot. Stir until just wilted, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve: Ladle the Sinigang na Baboy into bowls, making sure each serving has a good mix of pork, vegetables, and broth. Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy!</li>
