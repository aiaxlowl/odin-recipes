# Odin Recipes

This repository contains the source code for the "Recipes" project, part of the Foundations course in The Odin Project. The main objectives of this project are to practice using Git for version control and making meaningful commit messages, as well as utilizing HTML to structure web pages effectively.

## Project Overview

This project showcases three of my favorite Filipino dishes: **Filipino Spaghetti**, **Halo-halo**, and **Sinigang na Baboy**. The recipes featured on this website are generated by ChatGPT and may not be entirely accurate, as the primary goal is to demonstrate my HTML, Git, and CSS skills.

## Features

- HTML for proper page structure.
- CSS for styling and achieving the visual design I envisioned.
- Organized commit messages to practice good Git habits.

## Credits

- Images of the dishes used in this project are credited to their respective sources.
- Recipe content was generated by ChatGPT for demonstration purposes and may not be fully accurate.

## Update (08/28/2024)

I finally finished and personalized the content to highlight my top three favorite Filipino dishes. I used various CSS properties to create the desired look and feel for this website.
